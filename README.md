# spotify-consume-api
## this is me testing my api credentials and trying to fetch data from spotify.
## it worked well now i am going to do more testing and implement this in a react application.

-To fully make use of the demo you would have to create and obtain your own credentials from the spotify developer account 

-[spotify developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).
